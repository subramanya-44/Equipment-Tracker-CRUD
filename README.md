```
Equipment Tracker is a simple full-stack web application to manage equipment records.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate:
- clean REST API design
- simple React frontend
- clear project structure
- readable, maintainable code

This project was built as a take-home assignment.

---

## Features

- View equipment list
- Add new equipment
- Edit existing equipment
- Delete equipment

Frontend will be added later.
```

That’s it.
No over-explanation. No marketing language.
