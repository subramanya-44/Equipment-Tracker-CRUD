Equipment Tracker is a simple full-stack web application to manage equipment records.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate:
- clean REST API design
- simple React state management
- clear project structure
- readable and maintainable code

This project was built as a take-home assignment.

---

## Features

- View equipment list in a table
- Add new equipment
- Edit existing equipment
- Delete equipment
- Search equipment by name
- Filter equipment by type and status
- Sort equipment by name or last cleaned date
- pagination (yet to be implemented)

---

## Implementation Notes

- The backend exposes only basic CRUD REST APIs.
- Search, filter, and sort are implemented on the frontend using React state and plain JavaScript logic.
- This approach keeps the backend simple and works well for small datasets.
